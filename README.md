### What is it
This project is a custom motherboard designed to fit in the Thinkpad x201 and x201T variant.

### Why
Everybody loves Thinkpads, i especially love the Thinkpad x201. 
It's such a cute little laptop and when i held one in my hands for the first time i was surprised by many of its qualities, but especially the tough build and the size, needless to say it's my favourite Thinkpad in the whole lineup.
As for my friend, we're pretty much on the same page about it, laptop modding is something i've always wanted to try, she's really skilled at it already so we've teamed up, the x201 is our best candidate to show that this level of modding is doable!

### General specs
We decided to use a Lattepanda-mu SoM since we both each already own one and sourcing processors ourselves wouldn't have been easy, plus it has good documentation, example designs by Lattepanda, lots of IO, many already existing designs and most importantly it packs a punch since it mounts an x86 processor, available in two variants with the Intel N100 and N305.
